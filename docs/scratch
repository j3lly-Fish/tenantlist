1. All tenants.
2. Tenants should be allowed to create a business listing if one does not already exist for that brand, such as Starbucks for example. Then the tenant should be able to create a "listing" that shows demain of the tenant so landlords or brokers can supply that demand.
3. Omit until built. Just show the UI elements and leave the percents at 0.
4. Open to all tiers.
5. Simple internal messaging system. Edit the roadmap to reflect that.
6. Tracking should be available on the pro and premium tiers.
7. Name it proposals.
8. Yes, 3 citys is 3 separate listings.

Existing code is anything in the /home/anti/Documents/tenantlist folder. I suspect that we will be reusing the javascript and backend files. 

Visual Assets should match the figma as close as possible. There are additional desgin docs in ~./tenantlist/docs. We will add final design elements at a later stage so you can use placeholders as needed. 


1. Option A
2. Listing title can be anything. Not limited to the name. 
3. Less than 12 months, 1 year, Mid Term, and 5+ years.
4. Ensure that industrial is also being used as well. 
5. Let's change to asset type. 

Also, I want the fields to follow this design.
